Collection of notebooks exploring numerical weather prediction and other simulation stuff. 

Ideas for future work:
- with the 2d advection - shallow water equations, optimize speed and then plot waves and stuff on real bathymetry data? maybe show real wave data from era5 compared to your computed version?
